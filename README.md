# IdentityServer4 Getting Started Sample
My resulting project from following along [this blog instructional post](https://www.scottbrady91.com/Identity-Server/Getting-Started-with-IdentityServer-4)

The author's code sample is also located in [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/scottbrady91/IdentityServer4-Example).  This 
could have been a fork from that repo, but I wanted to start from scratch and follow the above mentioned article 
step-by-step to gain an understanding of how it all comes together.

This shows:
+ IdentityServer4 running in .NET Core
+ OAuth2
+ OpenIdConnect server & client
+ Client, user, and claims backed by a data store via EF Core
